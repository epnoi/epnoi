**epnoi** is an unified information access middleware which objective is to increase the awareness and simplify the 
search of relevant content in situations where multiple heterogeneous non-structured information sources are involved.

**epnoi** unifies the access and search activities to different information sources, encapsulating and relating the 
meaning of the knowledge objects that they contain, offering thus:
* A structured information space view, where the involved entities, their taxonomy and topics are explicitly 
annotated and can be used to explore the information space.
* A coherent information space view that abstracts away from the multiple information  sources, providing a 
single search and access interface in a transversal content-oriented manner.
